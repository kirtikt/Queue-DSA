# ðŸš€ Java Queue & Sliding Window Algorithms

This repository contains various Java programs that demonstrate core data structure concepts such as **Queue**, **Circular Queue**, and **Sliding Window** techniques. These examples are designed for educational purposes to help understand the behavior and implementation of queue-based data structures.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

### 1. `Queue_ADT.java`
Implements a queue using Javaâ€™s built-in `LinkedList` class. Provides basic queue operations like:
- Enqueue (add element)
- Dequeue (remove element)
- Check if the queue is empty

---

### 2. `Queue_linked.java`
Custom implementation of a queue using a singly linked list. Demonstrates:
- Manual node creation
- Handling front and rear pointers
- Queue operations without Java collections

---

### 3. `Circular_Queue.java`
Implements a **circular queue** using an array. Efficiently handles space by wrapping around the array using modulo operations. Useful for:
- Fixed-size queues
- Preventing overflow in standard queue operations

---

### 4. `Queue_reverse.java`
Reverses the **first `k` elements** of a queue using a stack:
- Maintains queue order for remaining elements
- Demonstrates queue-stack combination logic

---

### 5. `slidingwindow.java`
Solves the **maximum sum subarray problem** using the **Sliding Window** technique:
- Efficient for large arrays
- Optimized compared to brute-force methods

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Queue ADT and its variations (linked list, circular)
- Stack-queue interplay
- Array traversal optimization
- Modular arithmetic in data structures
- Time-space trade-offs in algorithm design
